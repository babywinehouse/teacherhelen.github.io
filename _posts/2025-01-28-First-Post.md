title:  "My First Blog Post"

This could be my first post! I can't believe I am learning how to code, I really thought that was just for proper nerds! That's just me coming out as a proper nerd now. And I imagine that this site might be something that I share along to colleagues and potential employers, so I am going to be free but professional in my tone for this space and these posts. 

I would like to talk about my journey as a teacher and do some professional reflection here, as well as showcase any work that I am doing that I feel proud of. One thing I have started to do is post videos to my YouTube channel where I read stories and sign songs. 

And that's really what I want for my life, regardless of my teaching - to be telling stories and singing songs!
