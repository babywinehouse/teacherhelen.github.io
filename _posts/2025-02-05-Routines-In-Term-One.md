Having a new class of young students with multiple disabilities and vision impairment, the first few weeks of school have been all about creating predictable routines. Working across different cognitive levels and access needs, it has been so interesting to get to know these learners and see what sticks for them and what needs reworking.

One thing that is sticking is an auditory schedule using a step-by-step story sequencer, comprised of six recordable buttons. Each day I've been changing just the 'Middle Session' button with our particular activity for that day, and the rest of the buttons stay the same. We started out with the following schedule:

1. Morning jobs and morning session
2. Morning tea
3. Middle session
4. Lunch time
5. Afternoon jobs
6. Home time

And I felt like keeping it really simple like that was going to help in terms of cognitive load for the students to understand what to expect. And I've also found it really useful in terms of keeping myself and the staff team accountable to making sure we are following a schedule and routine. 

During our first team meeting for the year, one of my teacher aides asked about having regular times to go to the toilet, as all our students are not yet independently toileting, so that is something that I wrote into our weekly schedule (I adapted a weekly and daily schedule from two other teachers in the school so I didn't have to make my own template!), but I found that as the students aren't regularly accessing our weekly timetable, I also wasn't looking at it much! So our 'talking schedule' now says:

1. Toilet, wash hands, morning jobs, morning session
2. Toilet, wash hands, morning tea
3. Middle session, maths games in the corridor (for example)
4. Toilet, wash hands, lunch time
5. Afternoon play, afternoon jobs, afternoon session
6. Home time

Which is keeping us all much more accountable to going to the toilet at regular times and making sure we are washing our hands before we eat. The students can refuse going to the toilet, but still need to wash their hands, and I am also seeing some communication either verbally or through Alternative Access Communication Devices to indicate that they need to go to the toilet outside of the scheduled times, which is awesome. 

Previously, I've been working with students whose communication is really hindered by medical issues, seizure activity or their *access* to communication is hindered by AAC system issues, so it's a real celebration to me every time I see one of my students communicating and advocating for themselves. 

I'm also blessed to have experienced and committed teacher aides working with me, as well as an amazing teaching partner, and as a team combined I'd hazard that we've got 40 years of experience in vision impairment education, which is pretty incredible. 

I'm going to keep posting about the things that are working for me and that I am adapting as I go, but here are some things that are on my brain right now that might make it into future posts:

- explicit phonics instruction for students with vision impairment
- early brailling and fine motor work for braille fingers
- how much fun I am having incorporating music into my literacy instruction
- maths and positional language


Thanks for reading! This blog is primarily written for me, so that I can I keep track of my process and the way that my thinking changes as I learn more about myself and the world of education.
